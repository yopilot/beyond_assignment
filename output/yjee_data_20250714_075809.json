      "selftext": "So today morning, as usual I was on my way to the office. After getting off from metro I was just casually walking while browsing reddit on my phone. In a few minutes I'd reached the sidewalk right outside my office building. Literally I was just 10 steps away from going inside the premises. (let's refer to office building as \"Petronas towers\") \n\nOutta nowhere, this auto riksha comes up to me, and the autowala asks me where I want to go. I just shook my head to signal \"nah, bro\" and make him go away. Usually, that's enough, but not for this guy!\n\nSince I was looking at my phone, bro somehow assumed that I was waiting for an Uber cuz he then said to me \"arre bhaiya, apka Ola Uber jitne der mein ayega, mai apko \u091b\u094b\u095c dunga. Batao kaha jana hai.\" I thought, okay, let's do a little trolling. So I sat in his auto, and said, \"Petronas towers jana hai, chalo.\"\n\nI watched his expression quickly change from triumph to an embarrassed smile as the realization dawned on him. He said kya yaar bhaiya mazze le rahe ho. I just got off , smiled and waved at him and went to work.",

      "selftext": "Does anyone else have/had this issue?? As written in title, my phone stops making sounds for notifications sometimes. The notification comes fine, there's the popup and also the vibration but there is just no sound! This issue happens once or twice every day. It does not get fixed no matter what I do, except restarting the phone.\n\n\nI have this phone for a month and this issue has been recurring since the beginning. I have checked every possible setting. All notifications are supposed to \"Alert\" and make sounds, none of them are set to be silent. DND is disabled. Volume is max on everything.  I have eliminated all the variables. I have scoured the internet but found nothing helpful. HELP ME. \n\n\nEdit: phone is NOT connected to any other device. NO watch,  no buds, no earphones,  no car stereo nothing.  Nada.\n\n\nThis issue is driving me mad because how the FUCK does such an expensive phone have such a basic functionality not working properly!!?? Like c'mon Samsung even my old $120 phone was always giving me sounds for notifications!\n\n\n\nupdate: I clicked on Settings->Apps->Three dots->\"Reset App preferences\" and that seems to have solved the issue somehow. It makes no sense, but well it iz wot it iz.\n\nupdate two: one thing I realised after resetting App preferences is, that this issue is basically caused whenever you disable Notifications for ANY Samsung official app. Be it Samsung Notes, Samsung Reminder, Samsung Members or any other godforsaken useless app that Samsung has pre-installed on the phone. I have to keep the notifications turned on for ALL of their apps, otherwise this issue is faced. Pretty shitty of Samsung to do this, ngl.\n\nUpdate 3: the issue sometimes re-occurs , another workaround I've discovered is to toggle both Bluetooth and DND from Off to On and then back to Off",

So I melted some Amul dark chocolate pieces and added it to the lassi. I also added a spoonful of vanilla icecream and some Hershey chocolate syrup since I had those lying around. \n\nThe result? Looks okay but tastes hilariously bad. Like really really bad. I didn't even want to drink more than one sip. I feel like I have committed a sin against the Lassi gods.

I realized it wasnt what I wanted though, it was what my parents wanted from me.\n\n\nIMO solving this dilemma really just comes to down to asking yourself some hard questions. You'll have to introspect a lot, figure out what are really *your* life's goals and priorities. What will give *you* the maximum contentness in the long run?\n\n 10-15 years down the line, do you see yourself hustling and grinding to reach the next quarter's targets or do you see yourself living a slow yet enjoyable life? Is your ambition out of an intrinsic drive to achieve some grand goal that keeps you up at night, or is it born out of comparing yourself to others? Ambition for the sake of ambition is like chasing a mirage\u2014restless, dazzling, but ultimately hollow. \n\nAlso remember, it is not a dichotomy. You can always hustle for a while, reach a peak that you're satisfied with, and quit at a high point to retire into a slow life. No regrets.",

You have to reach out and ask for help.You might be surprised at how much they have to offer.\n\nStart relying on people more. Don't let invisible walls keep you isolated from your closest people.
