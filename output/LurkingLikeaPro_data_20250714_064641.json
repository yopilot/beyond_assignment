      "selftext": "With the current heat wave, I've been experimenting with ResortPass and last week I went to the Virgin Hotel in Ktown/flatiron. It's my second time using ResortPass, my first time was at CODA Williamsburg.\n\nTLDR: I would definitely do Virgin Hotels again, but only a pool pass.\n\nI live in Manhattan, so Virgin was easy to get to. The pool pass is $50 and good for All Day. I chatted with a woman who arrived at 9 AM and left at 4, I arrived around 1 and left at 8:30 when the pool closed. Its a good deal for $50.\n\nWith the pool pass, you are not given a lounge chair. There are cubbies where you can put your stuff and a small seating area (2 tables, long booth and 4 chairs) where you can sit. This was perfect for me, because I didnt intend to get out of the pool.\n\nThe pool closes for 30 min twice a day. From 11-11:30 and from 4-4:30. They kick Everyone out, but theres an attached bar where you can sit and wait to re-enter. If you paid for a chaise (more expensive than a pool pass) it's only good for one of these segments. This is the main reason I prefer a pool pass.\n\nChildren are allowed in until 11, after 11:30 the pool is adults only. This wasn't strictly the case for me. Two families with a pre-teen child came in separately, but didn't stay long and weren't disruptive.\n\nThere are servers who walk around the pool and will bring your drinks right to you in the pool. I didnt get food, so I don't know if they would have let me eat while standing in the pool.\n\nThe vibe was adult but chill. Music was good, but not so loud you had to shout. Overall, it was a good time and I can definitely recommend it",

      "title": "How To Fortress As a Group: Auror Edition",
      "selftext": "With the rollout of the Knight Bus (Thank you Devs!!!) a lot of people are playing fortresses in groups for the first time. With that in mind, some tips and links to help you be the best teammate!\n\nAuror Skills (in order from left to right):\n\n\\- Weakening Hex - Lowers Foe's power by up to 50%\n\n\\- Bat Bogey Hex - Reduce a foe's stamina by 1 or 3\n\n\\- Focus Charm - Transfer focus to a teammate\n\n\\- Confusion Hex - Lower a Foe's Defense, Doge and Defense Breach\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFocus:\n\nWhen you're waiting to enter the chamber, look at what professions your teammates are. There are different strategies for different groupings, but in general, you want to give Professors most of your starting focus. Professors are able to raise your defense, make you more profiencient and add 40 power to each move, but each of those hexes takes 3 focus. If you have focus that you can't use, send it to a professor. If you have a magizoologists on your team, send them 1 or 2 focus in the beginning. They can cast a charm on the entire team that makes it easier to fight elite foes, but after that, most of their focus is used in ones or twos.\n\nTLDR: Give magizoologists 1 or 2 focus, but focus on the professors and share the wealth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHexes and Charms:\n\nAn Auror's Weakening Hex is super useful, but you need to ration your focus a bit at the beginning. My friends and I have the general rule that if there is a teammate who is proficient for the foe they are fighting, the weakening hex is only used on 5 stars. Once you have more focus, hex every foe. If a teammate is fighting a foe of any level where they aren't profiecient, then hex the foe for them.\n\nThe Confusion Hex is only useful for some foes, but doesn't hurt to add if you have the focus to spare. Erklings and Pixies are the most common use, because the hex prevents them from dodging. It's also useful to cast this on Dark Wizards and Werewolves, because it significantly lowers their attack. Don't waste it on Spiders or Death Eaters unless you're just trying to use up energy\n\nThe Bat Bogey Hex is an easy help IF you have a professor on the team. If a foe has been hex with the Professor's first hex, every Bat Bogey causes it to drop another 40 stamina. If there are no foes you're proficient in, and everyone else is working on foes, help them finish quicker by casting a few bat bogeys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPicking a Foe:\n\nAgain, look at your teammates. If you are the only auror on a team of professors, don't waste your time trying to fight a werewolf. If there's nothing you're proficient in, either jump in the lowest level foe you can find, or hang out for a bit and see if something better for you shows up. Or, use up a potion on one foe, and then head back to the chamber to check on your teammates. If they are better suited to fight, don't kill yourself to be helpful. The Bat Bogey hex is helpful enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLinks to other tips:\n\n\\- [Professions in Wizards Unite](https://wizardsunitehub.info/guide/choosing-profession-wizards-unite/#Auror%E2%80%99s_Spells)\n\n\\- Team Fortress Battles Advice from u/bliznitch/\n\n\\- [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterwu/comments/chafwu/some_observations_about_team_fortress_battles/)\n\n\\- [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterwu/comments/czpyhq/fortress_combat_team_strategies_part_ii/)\n\n\\- [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterwu/comments/d5jein/fortress_strategies_part_iii/)",

I cannot drop whatever I'm doing to help my family in order to cater to someone who has no interest in helping himself.\" \n\nWhen you get angry, he'll be hurt and confused because he's never seen this side of you before.
