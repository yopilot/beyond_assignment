But the issue is their Hindutva narrative has made non-Hindus enemies among the Hindu masses who view anyone not agreeing with their viewpoint as \"anti-national\"\n\nAlso even BJP has supported Diljit now, so yeah that's another story\n\nMoreover you talk about Sikhs have been advocating in khalistani, anti-antional blah blah things.\n\n\nSo tell me why Panjab 95 is not being allowed to release in India? Why are there so many roadblocks in the release of that movie? There have been literally 100+ cuts demanded by the board \ud83d\ude02 I mean just tell the producers directly to cancel the movie!\n\nBut yeah, there's no push of that news by the Hindutva ecosystem, or mainstream media!\n\nBut the whole country was being bombarded by news of the release of movies like Kashmiri files, kerala files with tax cuts, free shows organised in various states under BJP\n\nIsn't this open discrimination?
